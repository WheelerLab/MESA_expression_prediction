### GWAS Summary Statistics Tested:
- All Wojcik et al 2019 PAGE GWAS summary statistics (28 clinical and behavioral phenotypes)


### 01: Run S-PrediXcan with the GWAS Summary Statistics from the study
*Note that these files were accessed before the availability of the harmonised form.*

### 02: Generate Manhattan and QQ plots for each of the S-PrediXcan tests

### 03:

### 04: Combine all of the significant genes files together

### 05: Check if the new harmonised data released by GWAS Catalog matches the old GWAS Summary Statistics data and output by running S-PrediXcan on the White Blood Cell Count phenotype.

### 06-09: Preliminary script to properly format the input for LOCUS Comparer. 

### 10: Run Locus Comparer with eQTL and GWAS data to depict LD.

### 11: Merge the Locus Compare Plots for each Population into a pdf.
